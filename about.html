      <p>We are a group of diverse females that are passionate about
         uplifting other women of color to be the best versions of themselves -
          created from Kode With Klossy (an all girls coding program), we built this web app to
         provide a safe place that all women of color can visit to feel empowered
          by each others' acomplishments, and build a community amongst other women. Our team name was a combination of all of our names
          to form what is now...LIMARA!

        <p class="fiteme">Hello friends! My name is Karissa and I am an incoming freshmen entering
          highschool! As a child, my parents have always been pretty protective of
          me and my environment. As an Asian woman growing up in an area with many
          others like me, I have never really felt excluded because of my race. I
          have grown up in an environment where everyone was fairly smart, as well
          as financially stable. As I enter adulthood, I have become more and more
          exposed into the real world. After becoming aware of the discrimination
          amongst other women, I felt I needed to take action. Every woman should
          be able to feel important and have a sense of belonging. Through making
          a website with others with the same goals and ambitions, I can spread more
          awareness of this issue to others like me.</p>

        <p>My name is Kimberly Tlachi and I’m an incoming freshman in college. As
          a Hispanic living in the Eastern side of Washington it’s hard to fit in
          or feel comfortable. I had to deal with racist comments, sooner than later
          I adjusted and managed my way around those hateful comments. Growing up
          with Mexican parents I was always told that women belong in the kitchen
          and are here to serve men. When I got older I realized that wasn't true
          and that I had another purpose.</p>

        <p class="fiteme">Uh Ello! My name is Lin and I am a rising sophomore! As a child, my
          family was not really financially stable, even though people expected us
           to be because my family is a multi-racial family consists of mostly asian
           and indigeous background. But also it was sort of normal to hear conflict
           or negative things that are happening to women of color especially with
           the stereotypes of how women should act in society during my childhood
           as well. So yus.</p>
